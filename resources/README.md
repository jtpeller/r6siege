# Resources
Welcome to the resources page. If you're viewing this as a webpage, it means I haven't fixed the routing yet.

If you wanted to figure out where I found various images, here you go:

- R6 operator SVGs are sourced from: [link](https://r6operators.marcopixel.eu/)
- The background image is from: [link](https://static-dm.akamaized.net/siege/prod/7907369fa863844fc1ae432a9ca0e610.jpg)
    - which is from: [link](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege) as of March 28, 2022 (which might be stale)
- Gun PNGs are sourced from: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/assets).
    - Scroll down to find the "Weapon & Attachment icons" .zip
    - Some are also pulled from the official website: [link](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege)
- Gadget & Special images are sourced from the official website: [link](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege)

And of course, here is some fun legal stuff:
