# Resources
Welcome to the resources page. You probably shouldn't be here, but I don't feel like fixing the routing right now.
If you're viewing this on the GitHub repository, please disregard this.

Anyway, if you wanted to figure out where I found various images, here you go:

- R6 operator SVGs are sourced from: [link](https://r6operators.marcopixel.eu/)
- The background image is from: [link](https://static-dm.akamaized.net/siege/prod/7907369fa863844fc1ae432a9ca0e610.jpg)
    - which is from: [link](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege) as of March 28, 2022 (which might be stale)
- Gun PNGs are sourced from: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/assets).
    - Scroll down to find the "Weapon & Attachment icons" .zip

And of course, here is some fun legal stuff that I'm assuming are important:
